										<h2><a>Python<br />Projects</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a class="image fit"><img src="images/python-logo1.png.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p id="python-general" class="general-description">Here you will find a repository of all the Python projects I have completed. Some of these display basic Python capabilities, while others demonstrate more advanced Python skills.</p>
									<select onchange="showDescription('python', this.value)">
										<option value="">Select a project</option>
										<option value="project1">Camera Vision RPS</option>
										<option value="project2">Webscraper</option>
										<option value="project3">File Organiser</option>
										<option value="project4">Hangman</option>
										<option value="project5">BMI Calculator</option>
									</select>
									<div id="python-project1" class="project-description">
										<p>This project allows the user to play Rock, Paper, Scissors using a trained machine learning model and a device camera to capture user input. Users make hand gestures representing rock, paper, or scissors, which the model recognizes. The class includes methods for capturing the user's gesture, making a prediction using the model, and determining the game's outcome. The project demonstrates skills in machine learning model integration, computer vision with OpenCV, real-time video processing, and game logic implementation in Python.</p>
									</div>
									<div id="python-project2" class="project-description">
										<p>This project focuses on webscraping, which is useful for extracting information from  web pages. Once it receives a URL, it fetches content from the web page and parses it using the BS4 module. This project in particular extracts team stats of NHL teams since 1990. This project showcases skills in web scraping, HTML parsing, error handling, and data extraction, demonstrating the ability to automate the collection of web-based data efficiently.</p>
									</div>
									<div id="python-project3" class="project-description">
										<p>In this project I have created a file organising class which is designed to organize files in a specified directory by their extensions. The program begins by listing all file extensions in the directory and creates corresponding folders for each unique extension. It then sorts the files into these folders based on their extensions. The class demonstrates capabilities in file system navigation, directory creation, and file manipulation using Python's os and shutil libraries. This project showcases my proficiency in automating tasks, handling file operations, and working with Python's built-in libraries. In this folder you will also find the notebook where I created drafts and essentially used it as a sandbox for this project.</p>
									</div>
									<div id="python-project4" class="project-description">
										<p>This project is the Hangman game everybody knows and loves. It initializes with a list of words that the user can change as they wish, with a set number of lives. The class includes methods to check if a guessed letter is in the chosen word, update the word display, track the guessed letters, and reduce lives for incorrect guesses. The game features a visual representation of the hangman state and handles user input to ensure valid guesses. This project showcases skills in game logic development, user interaction handling, and basic graphics representation in text form.</p>
									</div>
									<div id="python-project5" class="project-description">
										<p>In this project, I developed a Python class that calculates Body Mass Index (BMI) and categorizes the result into weight groups. The program begins by prompting the user to input their height and weight, with error handling to ensure valid inputs. It then calculates the BMI and prints the result. Finally, the program evaluates the BMI and assigns it to a category: underweight, healthy range, overweight, obese, or severely obese. This project demonstrates my skills in user input handling, mathematical computation, and conditional logic.</p>

										<option value="project2">Exploratory Data Analysis</option>
									</select>
									<div id="sql-project1" class="project-description">
										<p>This SQL data cleaning project works as a preface to the subsequent project and does an early stage refining a layoffs dataset through steps such as removing duplicates, standardizing data, eliminating NULLs, and dropping unnecessary columns. A staging table is used to maintain the integrity of the raw data while transformations are applied. Key techniques include using ROW_NUMBER() for deduplication and ensuring consistent data formats. The cleaned data is stored in the layoffs_staging table, ready for further analysis. This systematic approach ensures the dataset is accurate, consistent, and optimized for querying.</p>
									</div>
									<div id="sql-project2" class="project-description">
										<p>This SQL project performs exploratory data analysis on layoffs, using the set-up from the previous project. Here, I use techniques like CTEs, aggregate functions, and window functions to explore trends in the table, revealing key insights such as the maximum layoffs of 12,000, industry distribution, and geographic disparities. CTEs and functions like SUM, AVG, and ROW_NUMBER help analyze data by industry, company, and time. The project demonstrates SQL skills in data retrieval, aggregation, and transformation, providing insights into layoff trends and their implications.</p>

									<a class="image fit"><img src="images/powerbi-logo.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p id="pbi-general" class="general-description">Power BI projects I have completed, all of which require understanding of DAX. Each folder includes the raw dataset as well as the dashboards created in Power BI.</p>

										<option value="project1">Plant Database</option>
										<option value="project2">Project 1</option>
									</select>
									<div id="pbi-project1" class="project-description">
										<p>This Power BI project focused on creating a condensed, dynamic performance report which capitalised and made use of switch measures and conditional formatting. This project also had a heavy amount of DAX involved to create calculated columns and various other measures that would go on to aid in creating this final report.</p>
									</div>
									<div id="pbi-project2" class="project-description">
										<p>This Power BI report is based on a YouTube survey taken which asked viewers career-focused, demographic questions. These questions were mainly targeted at viewers who had intentions of transitioning into data, and other future career aspirations they had. Unlike the plant database report which was heavily business focused, this was more focused on visualising data so one can get a good spread of what their viewers think about their current careers and what they hope for the future when it comes to data-centric careers. As this was a survey which involved various open-ended questions, heavy amounts of data-cleaning was required which followed a lot of data standardisation. A final report was created which displays all the relevant information in an aesthetically pleasing, easy to read format.</p>

										<p>This tableau project focuses on Air BnB dataset from Seattle. The dataset was comprised of 3 sheets. Listings, including full descriptions and average review score, Reviews, including unique id for each reviewer and detailed comments, and Calendar, including listing id and the price and availability for that day. This project involved me taking this data and presenting it in a visually appealing format, so any potential listers can see what the best avenue for them to go down is: What zipcode should they start leasing in? What is the best week to list their properties? How does bedroom availability and price fluctuate within zipcodes, and other various questions of the like are answered.</p>

									<p id="excel-general" class="general-description">A repository that houses a few Excel Projects. These include making a dashboard. As Excel is pretty basic with regards to data analysis, only one full project was carried out. However, I have included a spreadsheet which displays quite a few Excel skills a data analyst would require.</p>
									<select onchange="showDescription('excel', this.value)">
										<option value="">Select a project</option>
										<option value="project1">Excel Full Project Workbook</option>
										<option value="project2">Bike Sales Edited</option>
									</select>
									<div id="excel-project1" class="project-description">
										<p>This Excel project involved analysing a survey from various bike buyers with a heavy focus on both demographic and socioeconomic factors which would influence their purchasing decisions. Only a small amount of data cleaning was required, as the answers were multiple choice. However, standardisation was still required, even data categorisation with some columns were required. The final stage was the creation of an aesthetically pleasing report, with numerous visualisations and pivot tables, with slicers to allow the reader to filter data as they wish.</p>
									</div>
									<div id="excel-project2" class="project-description">
										<p>This is not a project, however it is a starting point to the above full project. Something which displays my skill in creating pivot tables, a very useful skill for a data analyst to have.</p>
